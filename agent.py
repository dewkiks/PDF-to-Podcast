                    - Interactive Dialogue: Make it lively by having the hosts ask each other questions, share reactions, and refer to one another by name throughout the episode.
                    - Clean & Easy Formatting: Format the script clearly, with speaker names and spacing that make it easy to read aloud during production.

                    Content Cleanup:
                    - Strip placeholder directions such as: [Soft music transition], [Music fades out], [Music fades in], [Dramatic pause], etc.

                    Expected Output Format:

                    Alex: "Welcome back to *Deep Dive Talks*! Today, we’re diving into [topic]—a subject that has more depth than most people realize."
